# Ackermann Algorithm

Different implementations of Ackermann algorithm
In computability theory, the Ackermann function, named after Wilhelm Ackermann, is one of the simplest and earliest-discovered examples of a total computable function that is not primitive recursive. 
All primitive recursive functions are total and computable, but the Ackermann function illustrates that not all total computable functions are primitive recursive.
